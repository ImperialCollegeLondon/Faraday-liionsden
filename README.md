# Liionsden

:warning: **Liionsden is currently in development** :warning:

Liionsden is a platform for storing data about lithium-ion batteries and their performance. It automatically parses data from the output files of battery cycler machines and stores this information in a database, associating it with specific experiments and devices. Metadata is stored about specific experiments, batches of devices and individual devices. 

The development server is running [here](https://liionsden.rcs.ic.ac.uk/exps) (internal to Imperial College). 

It will be possible to browse the database, as well as add to it, via a web-app and programatically via an API.

Liionsden is developed at Imperial College London, funded by the [Faraday Institution Multi-scale Modelling Project](https://www.faraday.ac.uk/research/lithium-ion/battery-system-modelling/). 

## Database structure

The database currently stores recorded cycler data along with metadata about:
- **Experiments:** protocol, equipment used, configuration... 
- **Devices:** batch number, specification, chemical composition...

A simplified version of the main `battDB` app is shown below. This does not include models in the `common` and `dfndb` app, which deal with data relating to users, organisations, materials, parameters, methods. 

## Usage

Public data in the database can be browsed using the web platform. Registered "contributor" users can add experimental data, register equipment and batches of devices via the web platform. 

In future, this will also be posible via the API.

## Local installation

If you want to run a local version of Liionsden, we recommend using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Full instructions to follow once the platform is in production.

### TODOs 

Generally development todo's should be tracked in [issues](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/Faraday-liionsden/issues)


* Optimise queries:
  * DataRange should store data in a non-admin class to avoid loading large files
  * Parameters should be CharField only - not FK to dfndb
* Multiple parsers support WIP
  * Re-implement all parsers - not that hard to do, and can use a much faster CSV parser instead of pandas, which takes about 30s/500MB
* Full Harvester API & local client (ideally GUI) - PyQt WIP
* validate experiment devices against config
* API Test Cases WIP
* User Flows (wizard-like interface)
* Get plotting working again
* REST API nested models, multiple objects per request
* Immutable History - HasImmutableHistory - ManyToMany: Common.HistoryLog (JSON)
  
### Thoughts 

* DataRange - plot X, Y, Y2
* RANGES TO PLOT Overlay - field in Experiment 
* FK relation from ExperimentDevice to BatchDevice using ON DELETE RESTRICT
* Needs CSV file download of selected columns / data range
* Needs to support data analysis
* should support all features in Luke's galvanalyser
    * Automatically create data ranges by analysis - With label to indicate autogenerated or not
    * Allow user to define data ranges - needs a "range editor" - fairly complex UI code
    * Interactive Legend - (Luke used 'plotly' to do this, which is part of Dash, which is why he used Dash) this plots selected ranghes in different colours on same axes
    * Configurable scaling & line thickness for high-res plots
    * Ability to save plot configuratrion
    * Align Start To Ref - need more info on what this does and what it is for
* Needs PLOTTING of data
    * [Django-plotly-dash](https://django-plotly-dash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) may be an excellent shortcut for me! This is an actively maintained (yay!) connector to allow plotly to be used in a django app
* Needs more parsers
    * Maccor
    * Novonix
    * Ivium
    * Neware
    * ...others?
    * USER-DEFINED PARSERS? Yes please. We don't want to be supporting 1001 cycler models and their quirks, for evermore.
* Needs a harvester (or API support for existing one) (issue #26)
* Search & Filter
    * Django should nake that easy. No manual SQL stuff
* Immutability of data (idea #8)
    * Add 'Last Created' and 'Last Modified' and 'owner' to HAsAttributes base class
    * Maybe a list of previous versions of self, if possible to do
* needs a name
    * liionsden?
    * galvanalyser?
    * battDB?
