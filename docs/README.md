LiIonsDen Electrochemistry Database
-----------------------------------------

Liionsden is a Web application comprising a database of electrochemical (Lithium Battery) experimental test data, ie Cyclic Voltammetry. Users (scientists) may upload data files from Battery Cycler machines via either the Web interface.

Ideas drawn from:

* 'Galvanalyser' by Luke Pitt and Prof. David Howey
* [liionsden by Ivan Kotegov at Imperial College](https://github.com/FaradayInstitution/liionsden)
* [Universal Battery Database by Samuel Buteau](https://github.com/Samuel-Buteau/universal-battery-database)
* [dfndb](https://github.com/ndrewwang/dfndb) by @ndrewwang
* Inspiration from commerical products such as [Voltaiq](http://www.voltaiq.com)
* Cycler machines software e.g. Biologic BT-Lab
